# Project2
The project was about calculating bank balances with and without regular deposits.
the basic display and the main were simple enough but the hard part for me has consistently been functions... they just don't click the way i wish they would.
thank goodness for the tutor system we have or it would have been a problem. i also think this is where it could use some shoring up.
I think the biggest transferrable skill to take from this would be the function. Or the ability to write functions. Its something i need to work on and really take in but once ive got it a huge hurdle will be overcome and ill be a bigger asset to whatever team im on.
with proper documentation the code should be fairly readable, and by using object oriented programming it should easily be scaleable and added to as needed.
